## General Data Protection Regulation: Highlights

I would like to share some information on the new GDPR. In may 2018 it will take effect. This new privacy regulation will have
tremendous consequences for a wide range of IT projects as more data will be labeled personal data and the rules directing how to handle
personal data will be significantly more strict. Moreover the fine for a company making a transgressions can amount to five percent of the
yearly revenue. All in all sufficient reason to discuss this with people working with sensitive data on a daily basis.
